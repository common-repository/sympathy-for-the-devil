This plugin puts random snippets of the lyric of "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones in the top right of your WordPress admin screens.

== Description ==

This is not just a plugin, it is practically a sacrilege. In Matt Mullenweg's original Hello Dolly plugin, I've replaced the "Hello, Dolly" lyrics with those of "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones ... because I sometimes prefer dark, brooding, snarling words atop my blog admin. How about you? I'm shocked, shocked I tell you, that no one has done this before. When activated you will randomly see a lyric from <cite>Sympathy for the Devil</cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload sympathy.php to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Sing or hum along with the lyrics in your admin panel at the top right.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Is this plugin compatible with Matt Mullenweg's "Hello Dolly"?

If If both Hello Dolly and Sympathy for the Devil are activated at the same time, both will work and the lyrics will overlap each other. This is recommended only for people who like that sort of thing, or who customarily play record albums backwards to listen for hidden messages.

Why would you bother releasing such a stupid plugin?

It is not *that* stupid. It took maybe five minutes to modify Matt's code. It made me happier than I was before. Besides, it shows how easy it would be to change the same plugin to put perhaps genuinely useful reminder information on the screen.
